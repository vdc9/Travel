    <h3> I love plane rides. They end with me seeing somewhere new or returning from a journey to savor the memories of where I've been. Sadly, I cannot travel every day or month so I can't see all of the wonder the world has to offer. Until then, here are some of the places I wish I could see. 

    </h3>

    <h3> Thankfully, I will get to see some new places in September.
